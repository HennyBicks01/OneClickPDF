# One Click PDF 

When brainstorming design options, we decided that a one click PDF function as a right click context menu would be a cool project to work on since it would solve a lot of technical difficulties that many people face from day-to-day. Since our team has a background when it comes to generalized IT work, we realized that a very common problem amongst technically challenged people is simply printing to a PDF. This concept of a one click PDF is not something that's completely new with Adobe pro having built-in functions for this but most of the time that functionality resides behind a paywall. this enterprise application hopes to bring a more lightweight easier way to simply right click a .doc or .txt file and create a copy or convert it into a pdf very similarly as to how 7-zip allows people to right click folders to compress them. 

## Mockup

While there wouldn’t be much of a mockup for this type of product using the example of 7-zip helps emphasize the sentiment. As an enterprise application like this is made exclusively for convenience purposes 

## Functional requirements 

### Theoretical #1 

As a person that works with text documents all day and needs them to be an e-mail appropriate format 

I would like an application that would streamline this while also following privacy policies unlike cloud converters 

using one click PDF helps streamline this down to a single click. 

### Theoretical #2 

As a person who creates a lot of word documents 

and doesn't like going through the hassle of individually converting them into PDF's by printing them 

one click PDF saves me lots of unnecessary time that can be spent doing other things 

### Requirements #1 

Given a consumer of one click PDF right clicks on a Word document 

when said person clicks on the show more options button and the right click context menu within File Explorer or on their desktop 

one click PDF implementation should pop up 

### Requirements #1 

Given a consumer of one click PDF right clicks on a text document  

when said person clicks on this show more options button on it the right click context menu 

one click PDF implementation should pop up 

### Requirements #1 (additional implementation) 

Given a consumer of one click PDF right clicks on multiple text documents through a shift click 

when said consumer clicks on the show more options button in the right click context menu 

one click PDF implementation should pop up allowing them to either convert or print all of the approved document types to a pdf 

### Requirements #1 (additional implementation) 

Give it a consumer of one click PDF right clicks on A folder comprised of only text documents or word documents or a combination of the two 

when set consumer clicks on the show more options button and the right click context menu 

a one click PDF implementation should pop up allowing them to convert the whole folder
